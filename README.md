# CbetaZenTexts

An effort to make the **CBETA canon** accessible to English speakers, with a focus on **Zen / Chan texts**.

This repository hosts a **collaborative translation project** built on top of the official CBETA XML corpus.  
It is designed to support large-scale translation while preserving the original TEI/XML structure and attribution.

## 📂 Repository Structure

### `xml-p5` — Original Chinese Texts

Contains **unmodified CBETA XML TEI P5 files**, mirrored from:

https://github.com/cbeta-org/xml-p5

**Source baseline snapshot:** January 2026

- Files are redistributed **unchanged**
- All original CBETA headers are preserved
- These files should not be edited

---

### `xml-p5t` — English Translations (Work in Progress)

Contains copies of the same XML files, with **English translations added**.

Not all files are translated yet. Coverage varies widely.

**Example translated text:**

- **T 1987A — The Record of Caoshan**  
  Location: `xml-p5t/T/T47/T47n1987A.xml`

Translated files **preserve the full original CBETA header**, with translation content added below it.

---

## ⚠️ Important: CBETA Non-Commercial Requirement

The CBETA texts are provided under a **non-commercial use requirement**.

In short:

- CBETA retains ownership of the original texts  
- Redistribution is allowed **only for non-commercial use**  
- The **full CBETA header must remain intact** in every file  
- Translations are subject to the same non-commercial condition  

Please don’t sell this material, and don’t remove or alter the CBETA headers.

## 📜 License & Attribution

The original XML texts are provided by:

**CBETA — Chinese Buddhist Electronic Text Association**  
財團法人佛教電子佛典基金會

Each file includes the official CBETA header, which contains the authoritative license and attribution language.

This repository **does not modify or override** CBETA’s license terms.

## 📝 About the Translations

English translations in `xml-p5t` are **collaborative derivative works** based on CBETA’s XML.

They aim to:

- Preserve TEI/XML structure compatibility
- Stay aligned with the original Chinese text
- Allow transparent collaboration and review

Translations are shared under the **same non-commercial condition** as the original CBETA texts.

## 🧠 Translation Philosophy

This project is designed to support **high-quality machine translation workflows**.

You do not need to produce literary perfection.

Good machine translation is:

- Acceptable  
- Encouraged  
- Often preferred as a baseline  

The structure is built to allow iterative improvement over time.

## 🎥 Video: Translating with ChatGPT (Workflow Walkthrough)

If you want to see the end-to-end workflow in action, here’s a video walkthrough showing how to translate texts in this repository using **ChatGPT** alongside **CBETA Translator**:

- **Video:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDwJJrbx-dA  
- **Demo text:** *Recorded Sayings of Zhaozhou* (趙州錄)

This approach is fast and practical for large texts: using this workflow, the entire **Blue Cliff Record** was translated in about **one hour** as a first-pass machine translation baseline, ready for later review and refinement.

## 📝 Please Add a Translator Annotation

At the top of the file (in Readable mode), please add a short annotation indicating:

- Who you are  
- What you did  
- Whether you used machine translation  

Example:
resp: dota2nub
annotation: Machine translation using ChatGPT 5.2


This helps:

- Track translation methods  
- Maintain transparency  
- Credit contributors  

You do not need to write an essay. One short line is enough.

## 📌 A Few Guidelines

- Preserve all XML structure  
- Do not remove CBETA headers  
- Keep translations non-commercial  
- Small improvements are welcome  

You do not need to translate an entire text at once. Even a small improvement helps.
