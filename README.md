# CbetaZenTexts
Attempt to make the cbeta cannon accessible to English speakers, particularly the Zen texts.

xml-p5 contains the cbeta texts from this repository: https://github.com/cbeta-org/xml-p5 dated January 2026
xml-p5T contains the same exact files, but some are translated. As of the time of writing, that's only T 1987A - The record of Dongshan.
